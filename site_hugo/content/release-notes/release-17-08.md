This resease was initiated by an error report from a user and due to my development environment I decided to bite the bullet and use a more recent version of the .Net Framework. 
I will probably do a lot of work on the graphics now that I can use WPF instead of WinForms.

Please let me know if you find any errors or come up with an awesome idea that you think would fit in logview4net.


**Here are the changes for 17.08:**

  * Change .Net version to 4.5.2
  * Fix: An exception when loading configurations from file.
